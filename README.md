# UBC-ECON-398
This repository contains my term paper project for **ECON-398: Introduction to Applied Economics** with Professor Jonathan L. Graves at the University of British Columbia.

The paper uses Canadian survey data during the COVID-19 pandemic to run descriptive regressions linking social media use to symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder.
